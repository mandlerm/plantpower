## Usage

Welcome to the McDougall Recipe Collection.  We have provided recipe information found at Dr. McDougall's searchable recipe page (https://www.drmcdougall.com/health/education/recipes/mcdougall-recipes/)

You will be provided with a list of recipe categories.  Select which category you want to explore by entering the associated list number.

You will then see a list of all recipes in that category.  Once again, enter the list number of the desired recipe, and you will see the recipe listing: prep time, ingredients list and directions for preparation.

I hope you find this a helpful resource.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
